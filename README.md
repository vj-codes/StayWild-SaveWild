## Inspiration
Wildlife trafficking is more common than you think, affecting people, animal species, and challenging conservation. Tech companies have blocked more than 11.6 million transactions for endangered wildlife online according to a report. Obtaining accurate data from online animal trading websites through web scrapping is impossible, so we shall make an effort to prevent these illegal and lethal activities.

## What it does
StayWild-SaveWild is a crowd-sourced web app that allows users to share illegal animal trafficking sites present on the internet and the authorities or organizations dealing with it can take appropriate action on the data collected from the users.
People care about wildlife trafficking but lack the tools to help. People want to contribute to this cause, thus gamifying and adding incentives for users makes the work fun. Users get to have a way they connect with the cause and invest in it, thus the initiative StayWild-SaveWild !

## How we built it
Frontend built using Vue using a bootstrapped UI library and Airtable for the backend API.

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge was deciding the approach and workflow of the project and once that was finalized another challenge was creating the user interface. As I am the only one who was building it, time management was also difficult for me.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building a complete MVP within such a short time as a solo participant and creating a project in Vue for the first time.

## What we learned
It seems like I was living under a rock not being aware of how popular wildlife trafficking and poaching is on the internet. It breaks my heart to see these illegal activities on the internet, which I used to consider a safe place for everyone using it. However, humanity is still alive, and together through various initiatives, we can make a huge difference.

## What's next for StayWild-SaveWild
Using machine learning to develop a similar model with more accuracy and partnering with an organization that deals with wildlife trafficking to make StayWild-SaveWild a real-world project!
